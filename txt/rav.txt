SiegedSec brings the next OpTransRights2 breach! 

BREAKING NEWS: kitten hackers are invading transphobic organisations, oh no :3c

This time, we've hacked Real America's Voice, a news source spreading misinformation and transphobia. This hack reveals the personal information of 1,200+ individuals on their app, such as full name, phone number, email address.
we also went poof on their files, we wiped the user data from their API and wiped their AWS S3 bucket :3

Dear Robert Sigg,
krill urself ü¶ê ^-^
Love, SiegedSec. 

The hack starts with just a single cabinet
and before you can ban it there's havoc and mass panic
It propagates throughout your whole network
Sorry Mr. Sigg, there goes your fuckin' networth

throughout our attacks on transphobic entities, we have recieved concerns that our attacks will be used to label the LGBTQ+ community as "terrorists" and "criminals". 
the thing is, these types of people will blame the LGBTQ+ community regardless of what we do. they will look for a reason to hate, they won't listen to reason, they want to spread lies to shun people different than them. 
and so here we are, fighting back in our own way, delivering justice to those who spread hate. you can help too! not all change has to be criminal, but not all change happens peacefully.
