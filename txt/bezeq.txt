SiegedSec is here for a special Halloween Hack!

This special hack affects.... (drum roll please)
BEZEQ! Israel's largest telecommunications company!
We have brought several surprises for Bezeq, we hope they enjoy our treats~

For our first treat to Bezeq, we have exfiltrated their customer database, containing nearly 50,000 customer full names, email addresses, and phone numbers. 

Our second treat affects the entirety of Israel's infrastructure, we have accessed the portal that controls devices from around the country, and we've shut them down~ :3 This also affects devices from the Hungary, Finland, and U.S Embassies in Israel. so exciting amirite? 

Last but not least, our third and final treat, we've used Bezeq's campaign management portal to send a fun little email to Bezeq customers! >w< 

We hope you enjoy this special halloween hack! We have lots more in mind for future hacks so stay tuned~
