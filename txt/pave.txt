SiegedSec begins Operation PAVE!

This operation aims to retaliate against North Carolinan sponsors of House Bill 8, Pornography Age Verification Enforcement (PAVE) Act. 
Forcing porn distributors/publishers to verify age of consumers by identification card is a major privacy risk and will not actually stop minors from accessing porn. This bill also contains intentionally vague wording, potentially allowing queer content to be included as "material that is harmful to minors."

"the wars of the future will not be fought by strong soldiers, but by anarchist trans catgirl hackers"

mew mew, in this first attack, we have released the full personal information of all sponsors of this bill. this information contains addresses, phone numbers, passwords, email addresses, personal social media, and more!
