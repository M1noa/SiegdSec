hello everynyan :D time for our April Fool's Day hack! 
SiegedSec has spent the past few days sharpening our claws and strengthening our bite, to deliver karma :3

Recently, we recieved a report via email of a church pastor causing problems with transgender individuals, as well as publicly posting transphobia. this reporter brought forward valuable information we used to target the church. 
(if you have reports like these, our signal is cybercrimecat.69, or email us youranonwolf@riseup.net)

today's target is River Valley church, and we've got a special surprise for them <3

-Leopard boy

To start off with voring the River Valley church, we've hacked accounts allowing us to spend their dirty money~ so what did we do with this power? we bought hundreds of inflatable sea lions (+ other bs) :3 
And you might think, "But SiegedSec! You could've donated that!" trust me, we tried, it wasnt going to work :(

next, we have compiled thousands of their user's full names and prayer info! this totals to around 15k records. mmmm crunchy ^-^
